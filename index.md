# Urgent Call for Collective OPCW Action on Iran’s Suspected Use of Chemical Agents Against Civilians

We, an open coalition of human rights organizations, civil society groups, victims’ advocates, and concerned citizens, call on OPCW Member States to invoke Article IX of the Chemical Weapons Convention and initiate an independent, international investigation into Iran’s suspected use of prohibited chemical agents against civilians, including protesters and school-aged children.
